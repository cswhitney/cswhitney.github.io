<em>Experimental Design as a Multi-modal Discovery Tool:</em> I employ experimental design methodologies to identify and correlate structurally significant features across both mechanical and chemical domains, accelerating the discovery of high-impact system properties.

<em>Multiscale Modeling as a Bridging Strategy:<e/m> I use computational modeling to bridge molecular dynamics with system-level performance, encompassing mechanical behavior, electrochemical response, and system dynamics. These models are crucial for refining designs, predicting outcomes, and optimizing performance under extreme conditions.

Together, these approaches enable the development of robust, multifunctional technologies that not only meet but exceed the demands of the most challenging applicationsâ€”from deep space exploration to next-generation industrial systems.
